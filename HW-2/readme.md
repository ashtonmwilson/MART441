# Thoughts from this week:
I am picking up momentum, and putting house projects on hold in spite of my wife...
glad the progression is simple, for my sake.

stoked to have been shown grass hopper!

## Some questions I came across that I will be researching:
* i wonder why  "/*" is colored.. in.js files what does it do on it's own?
* is there a way to open up the atom panels vertically?
* is there a way to open up a browser panel in atom?
* reconnecting git hub to the files on my computer after a crash: see estra file in my images folder
* WHy does his example not include the css folder? is he lnking to the HW-1 folder? also no images folder... see image labeled
