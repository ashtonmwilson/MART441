# Thoughts from this week:
Moving right along, excited to learn new javascript tools.

## Some challenges I faced:
* Problem solving getting things to communicate from the .html to the main.js
* In an attempt to better understand the buttons layout in the week3 example I attempted to add a nother button, with additional choices, this proved verry difficult.
