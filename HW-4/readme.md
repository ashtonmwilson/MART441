# Thoughts from this week:
Moving right along, excited to learn new javascript tools.

## Some challenges I faced:
* i still struggle with the little things, spelling, and remembering tags.
* Realising as a visual learner, a diagram with both the .js and the Html next to eachother, with lines drasn back and fourth connecting the paths would really help, maybe I'll make some this sumer.
* I am not sure why sometimes when a selection is made, the formatting stays... and other times it does not, even when the code is the same.
* Really appreciated the walk through, Having examples on the site that are built inside html rather then between the three documents is hard for me. I appreciate the ability to pause the video, and then build my own version.
